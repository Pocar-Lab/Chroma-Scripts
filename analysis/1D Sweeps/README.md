## Purpose  
We want to verify the accuracy of our Chroma model and limit errors due to incorrect parameters. The goal of this is to understand how much of effect varying each optical parameter has on PTE in a 1D sweep through 5 sigma of literature values.

## Method  
We analyze Copper refractive index, copper specular ratio, silica window, Xenon refractive index, xenon rayleigh scattering length, xenon absorption length
