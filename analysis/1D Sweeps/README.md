## Purpose  
We want to verify the accuracy of our Chroma model and limit errors due to incorrect parameters. The goal of this is to understand how much of effect varying each optical parameter has on PTE in a 1D sweep through 5 sigma of literature values.

## Literature Values/ Sources:

LXe Scattering Length: 1.66 +/- 0.0004 to 1.69 +/- .02 via Kristian density vs depth report

LXe Attenuation (absorption length) 66 +/- 3 cm https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168900217306848?via%3Dihub

LXe Scattering 35 +/- 2 cm (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168900217306848?via%3Dihub)
