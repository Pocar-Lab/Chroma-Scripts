Analysis Done on 10-2-2024 by Loick Marion and Nick Yazbek (maybe)

The point of this is to redo the Analysis by Luc but to try and reduce correlation between results different silicon runs.

Components of Analysis:

1. Determine whether subtracting runs seems to limit correlation
    This was do ne by running 8 reflector runs, 4 reflector runs, and no reflector runs. The histograms from each runs are 
    subtracted (8  refector - 4 reflector, 4 reflector - 0 reflector) so see if this isolates the peak, which would indicate that subtracting the ptes 
    would yield a less correlated cost function.

2. Determine the necessary index of refraction values to simulate over
    Nick plz describe

3. Determine the necessary number of photons to run to determine uncertainty?
    idk if we should do this bc the uncertainty calculation doesnt seem trivial

4. Run the parameter sweep

5.
