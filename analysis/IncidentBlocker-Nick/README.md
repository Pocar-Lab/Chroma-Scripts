## Purpose  
We found (20240802 Chroma Slides, Luc's Augsut 2024 Analysis) that the 4 and 8 reflector runs are very correlated. Part of the reason for this correlation is that much of the light is the same in both configurations, i.e., there are similar large amounts of direct photon hits that overshadow the differences between the 8 and 4 reflectors. One potential solution is to introduce an object on top of the silica window that would block some of the incident hits, hopefully making the runs more distinct.

## Method  
First, the size of the blocker was varied until the incident light counts were reduced by 40 percent. Then, the alpha ratio was calculated to evaluate the impact of the blocker.

## Results  
Initial results look promising, but there were two main issues. First, some major variables, primarily the size of the source (the initial method was done using a point source), would have a significant effect on the results. Secondly, it was calculated that the size of the blocker would need to be (X mm Nick, please enter), which would be difficult to fabricate precisely in an experimental setup.

## Future Work  
It could prove fruitful to reanalyze the blocker idea using a disk source and then use the results in some Julia parameter sweeps to refine the analysis and address the experimental difficulties.
