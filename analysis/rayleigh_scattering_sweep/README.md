## Purpose  
We assume in our simulations that no Rayleigh scattering occurs. However, in reality, Rayleigh scattering does happen. This analysis aims to compare the Photon Transport Efficiency (PTE) ratio of the silicon no reflector and copper no reflector runs to the respective alpha ratio, in order to determine the best-fit value for the Rayleigh scattering length. These runs were chosen because, without reflectors, the PTE will largely be influenced by changing the properties of xenon.

## Method  
Simulations were run for both the silicon no reflector and xenon no reflector runs at various Rayleigh scattering lengths. The ratio of PTE at each step was compared to that of the alpha ratios to determine the best-fit scattering length.

## Results  
The best-fit value for the scattering length was determined to be 33.2 cm. This roughly aligns with the literature value of 30 cm. Future simulations should be run with literature Rayleigh scattering values.

## Future Work  
This analysis could be repeated both with higher statistics and by comparing other combinations of no reflector runs to better confirm the impact of Rayleigh scattering length.
