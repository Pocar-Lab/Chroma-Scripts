# Title: Subtracting Runs Concept  

**Dates**: August 06, 2024 - August 13, 2024
**Researcher**: Loick Marion

---

## Purpose  
We have determined (leave space) that there is too much correlation between the 8 and 4 reflector runs. One potential solution is to subtract the differences between the 8 and 4 reflector runs, as well as the 4 and 0 reflector runs. In theory, this would isolate the peaks that are unique to each run, making the runs more distinct.

---

## Method  
Simulations were run using the 8, 4, and 0 reflector Tall and Short silicon runs. The histograms were saved and then subtracted from each other to analyze the differences.

---

## Results  
We were effectively able to isolate the peaks. However, an uncertainty analysis has determined that experimental uncertainty is too high for the result to be of any practical use.

---

## Future Work  
If the experimental uncertainty is ever significantly reduced, this analysis should be revisited as it could be highly beneficial. Ideally, it would be combined with a parameter sweep to determine if the fit lines have different shapes.
