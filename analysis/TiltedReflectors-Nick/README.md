# Tilted Reflector Analysis  
*Date Started: October 31, 2024*

## Overview  
- **Title**: Tilted Reflector Analysis  
- **Date Started**: October 31, 2024  
- **Researchers**: Nick Yazbek

## Purpose  
Due to findings (20240802 Chroma Slides, Luc's Augsut 2024 Analysis) we realized that the 4 and 8 reflector configurations are very correlated, making it challenging to use both of them to break degeneracies. From (20240806 Chroma Slides), brainstorming different ways to break the degeneracies, only a few methods seemed plausible. Tilting the reflectors was one of them. This study aims to simulate the effects of tilting the reflectors to see if it can help us get meaningful results on the reflectivity of silicon.

## Methods  
Geometries were created by fitting the bottom of the reflector into the inner groove and the top of the reflector into the outer groove. Simulations were then run to observe the effects of tilting the reflectors.

## Results  
The simulations showed that there wouldn't be enough reflected light to extract sufficient information. The direct hits heavily dominate the amount of light, which prevents us from gaining meaningful data about the reflected photon behavior. Perhaps this analysis could be revisited in the future with a light blocker or by using a specular lobe surface model.

## Future Work
This line of analysis is likely a dead end, but potential paths include:  
- Revisiting the analysis with a light blocker to reduce direct hits
- Exploring the impact of a specular lobe surface model on reflected photon behavior
