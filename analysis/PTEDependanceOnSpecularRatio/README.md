## Purpose  
We assume that varying the specular ratio has a linear effect on PTE (Photon Transport Efficiency). This code aims to verify that assumption by running simulations at varying specular ratios and observing the results.

## Method  
Several simulations were run, each varying the specular ratio of silicon at each step. The goal was to observe any changes in the PTE as the specular ratio was adjusted.

## Results  
The simulations confirmed that the specular ratio has a linear impact on PTE. As the specular ratio increased, PTE also increased in a linear fashion, supporting the initial hypothesis.
